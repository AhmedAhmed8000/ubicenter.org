<h2>The UBI Center open sources all our models</h2>
###### We open-source all our models at [github.com/UBICenter](github.com/UBICenter). ######
There you can see our code, file issues we're working on, and see how we're progressing against those priorities.
<br>
All our work uses open-source projects and data. In particular, our Census data comes from the [Open Source Policy Center's](https://www.ospc.org) Tax-Calculator project, and we use Python and Jupyter notebooks. We contribute to these projects whenever possible.

<center><h2>We leverage and contribute to existing open-source projects, and open-source our own analysis.</h2></center>
